There are three secretion conditions for calcium measurements (`8G`, `8G/QLA`, `8G/QLA/GIP`), defined below.
Islet proteomic data were not collected in any secretion conditions. Distinct mice were assayed for `calcium` and
`protein`. Individual strains can be selected on the main menu using the checkboxes, or all strains (default) can be viewed.

The different options in the main pull-down menu are:

- `calcium`: calcium traces & spectral density with condition
- `protein`: islet proteomic measurements
- `basal`: average calcium in 2mM glucose

For `calcium`:
Parameters listed in `calcium` (e.g. `AD` for active duration) are displayed across all secretion conditions. These
can be selected from the second pull-down menu.

For `protein`:
Proteomic data are displayed for each identified peptide. In rare cases where proteins have multiple peptides, gene symbol
and peptide identifier (PP number) are included (e.g. `Pkm_PP_1521` for the M1 isoform of the protein PKM). Desired proteins
can be selected simultaneously with desired calcium parameters for correlation analysis and paired display by selecting them
in the second pull-down menu.

For `basal`:
While some elements are currently retained from the `calcium` data display settings, the only element of experimental relevance is
the Average Calcium measurement, reflecting the calcium in non-stimulatory 2mM glucose.
